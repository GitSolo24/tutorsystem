Describes details of the project. 

Repo was redited today. you guys can go ahead and clone your repo again. make sure the project folder is in this directory C:/xampp/htdocs/ (github will create the project folder automatically). So that our files can work with xampp as we test them. do not forget to create your own branch when working. Ask if you need me to explain any issues. Please avoid merging locally as it will cause all kinds of issues
